  PalmSource 2000 - Conference Guide is *free*, but you can always meet up
  with me during the conference and buy me a beer if this program has been
  of any use to you!  I will be speaking in the  817RT session - come meet 
  up with me! The entire contents of this application were taken from the
  official PalmSource website (and may have errors):

                         http://www.palmsource.com/
  
  This  application is a test program for a new help  system being created 
  that will revolutionize the  manner in which  users  interact with their
  help systems  within Palm Computing Platform applications.  What you are
  installing is a  HUGE help system!  Nothing more!  More details  will be 
  released slightly after PalmSource, but feel what your apps could have! 

  Around 20 hours was put into this product :) FYI  

  Thankyou for downloading and trying PalmSource 2000 - Conference Guide!
